This project is a desktop based chat application, where BSMRSTU Students and teachers are chating 
with multiple people at a time. Users can go offline and also see the messages from other side
but no one can see in online. 
For this project i'm using Java, JavaFX(Frontend), Socket Programming(established connection between server and socket)
